Our couple of reports have been leaked to avoid this. We have created a tool to encrypt your reports. Please check the pin feature of this application and report any issue that you get as this application is still in development. We have modified the tool a little bit that you can only use the pin feature now. The encrypt function is there but you can't use it now.The PIN should be in your inbox
